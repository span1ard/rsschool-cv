My CV

Ilya; email: span1ard@protonmail.com

-Summary-
I have been working as software developer for many years. I have done a wide range of tasks, but I never touched front-end side. To fix it I signed up for the RSSchool course.

-Experience-
I have my own pet project (online game), that grown up as much as I did not expected. It has been quite popular for ten years (2008-2018). My role was as project manager and one of software developers. Since 2018 the project was lost idea actuality, but all services still works for the last players, and I still spend some time for maintence.
Now and then (since 2018), I work as freelance python developer. Not full time, just a hobby. I have public profile on `Upwork` platform with various completed tasks and good feedbacks.
